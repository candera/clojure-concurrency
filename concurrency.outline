* Concurrent Programming in Clojure

* Motivation

- State of concurrent programming today
  - Summary: Manual locking sucks

- Multicore inevitable
  - Power limitations
  - Already here

* Locks are broken

- Too hard
- No runtime enforcement
- Deadlock and race conditions common

* A Better Way

- Default to immutability
- Provide reasonable primitives for mutation
- This is the Clojure approach

* Clojure

- A Lisp
- Hosted on JVM (or CLR)
- Dynamic
- Functional (non-pure)
- Immutable data structures
- Built-in STM

* Clojure Atomic Datatypes

- int, float, string, etc.

1
1.3
"blah blah"

- rationals, big integers

21/7
123456789012344567

- Keywords

:foo
:com.wangdera.com/namespaces/example:bar

* Composite Datatypes

- List

(1 2 "three" 4.0)

- Array

[1 2 "three" 4.0]

- Set

#{1 2 "three" 4.0}

- Map

{:a 1, :b "two", :c 3.0}

* Evaluation

- Many things evaluate to themselves

1 => 1
[1 2 3] => [1 2 3]
"blah" => "blah"

- Lists apply first item as function to rest

(+ 2 3 4 5 6) => 20
(my-add 2 2) => 5
(:a {:a 3, :b 4}) => 3

- Quoting a list prevents evaluation

'(1 2 3) => (1 2 3)

- Interop deeply integrated

(import '(java.util Date))

(new Date)
(Date.)

(. (new Date) (toString))
(.toString (new Date))

* Clojure's Approach to Concurrency

- Local Concurrency Only
  - Distributed concurrency not addressed at language level
  - But see Terracotta

- Freeze the world so we can look at it
  - Racewalk example

* Immutability

- Key to Clojure's approach to concurrency

- All built-in datatypes immutable

- Modification operations return new, immutable instance
  - Like System.String in .NET

(def foo {:a 1})
(assoc foo :b 2) => {:a 1, :b 2}
foo => {:a 1}

- Sophisticated data sharing semantics to manage perf
  - a.k.a. Persistent Data Structures

* The Four Reference Types

- Var:   Isolated changes within a thread
- Atom:  Shared +  synchronous + autonomous
- Agent: Shared + asynchronous + autonomous
- Ref:   Shared +  synchronous + coordinated

- Sharing: Can changes be seen by more than one thread?
- Synchronicity: Does it happen now or some time later? 
- Coordination: Do multiple changes happen atomically?

* Vars, Threads, and Binding

- Clojure binds values on a per-thread basis by default
- Because values are immutable, many concurrency issues 
  disappear
- The "Bad Spock Universe" model
- binding macro gives var new thread-local value
- If no thread-local binding, root binding is used

* Vars, Threads, and Binding

(def foo {:name "Craig" :age 37.99})  ;; Root binding

(defn print-foo 
  ([] (print-foo ""))
  ([prefix] (println prefix foo)))

(binding [foo 3]
  (print-foo))

(print-foo)

(import '(java.lang Thread))

(defn with-new-thread [f] 
  (.start (Thread. f)))

(with-new-thread (fn [] (print-foo "thread:")))

(do
 (binding [foo "Keith"]
   (with-new-thread (fn [] (print-foo "background : ")))
   (print-foo "foreground1: "))
 (print-foo "foreground2: "))
	
* Mutable References

- Immutable values only get you so far
- Need a level of indirection over a value. 
- Use references to freeze world 
- Look at it all day long via explicit dereference
  - deref function or @ reader macro  
- They are the only thing that mutate 
  - Outside of Java interop
  - (And transients)
  - TODO: Learn more about transients

* Atoms

- Manage an independent value
- State changes through swap! using ordinary function
- Change occurs synchronously on called thread
- Models compare-and-set (CAS) spin swap
- Function may be called more than once
- Guaranteed atomic transition
  - Must avoid side-effects

* Atoms

(def foo (atom {:blah "this"}))

@foo => {:blah "this"}

;; Equivalently: (deref foo)

(swap! foo (fn [a] 3))

@foo => 3

(swap! foo inc)

@foo => 4

(pmap 
 (fn [_] (swap! foo inc)) 
 (range 10000))

@foo => 10004

(def foo (atom 0))
(def call-counter (atom 0))

(import '(java.lang Thread))

(defn slow-inc-with-call-count [x] 
  (swap! call-counter inc)
  (Thread/sleep 100)
  (inc x))

(pmap 
 (fn [_] (swap! foo slow-inc-with-call-count)) 
 (range 100))

@call-counter => some number greater than 100

* Agents

- Manage an independent value
- Changes through ordinary function executed asynchronously
- They do compose with transactions, allowing for deferred side effects
- Not actors: not distributed

* Agents

(def my-agent (agent {:name "craig-andera" :favorites []}))

@my-agent => {:name "craig-andera" :favorites []}

(defn slow-append-favorite [val new-fav] 
  (Thread/sleep 2000)
  (assoc val :favorites (cons new-fav (:favorites val))))

(do (send my-agent slow-append-favorite "food")
    (println @my-agent)
  (Thread/sleep 2000)
  (println @my-agent))

@my-agent => {:name "craig-andera" :favorites ("food")}

* Agents, Watchers, and Errors

TODO

* Refs

- Allow for synchronous changes to shared state
- Refs can only be changed within a transaction
- Software Transactional Memory (STM) system
- Retries are automatic
- Therefore, there should be no side effects

* Refs

(def foo (ref {:first "Craig" :last "Andera" :children 1}))

@foo => {:first "Craig" :last "Andera" :children 1}

;; Creates a new value
(assoc @foo :blog "http://pluralsight.com/craig")
=>  {:first "Craig" 
     :last "Andera" 
     :children 1 
     :blog "http://pluralsight.com/craig"}

;; Note: no change
@foo => {:first "Craig" :last "Andera" :children 1}

(commute foo assoc :blog "http://pluralsight.com/craig")
=> IllegalStateException: no transaction running

(dosync 
 (alter foo assoc :blog "http://pluralsight.com/craig"))
(dosync 
 (commute foo assoc :blog "http://pluralsight.com/craig"))

* A Little Support Code 

(import '(java.lang Thread))

(defmacro with-new-thread [& body]
  `(.start (Thread. (fn [] ~@body))))

(comment (macroexpand-1 '(with-new-thread (print-foo))))

(def r (ref 0))

* Concurrent Writes

(dosync (ref-set r 0))

;; WRONG WRONG WRONG!
;; (dosync (ref-set r (inc @r)))

(with-new-thread
  (dosync 
   (println "tx1 initial")
   (alter r inc)
   (println "tx1 final:" @r)
   (Thread/sleep 5000)
   (println "tx1 done")))

(with-new-thread
  (dosync
   (println "tx2 initial:" @r)
   (Thread/sleep 1000)
   (alter r inc)
   (println "tx2 final:" @r)
   (println "tx2 done")))

* Reading Refs Absent a Transaction

(with-new-thread
  (dotimes [_ 10]
    (Thread/sleep 1000)
    (dosync (alter r inc))
    (println "updated ref to" @r)))

(with-new-thread
  (dotimes [_ 7]
    (println "ref is" @r)
    (Thread/sleep 1000)))

* Reading Refs Inside a Transaction 

(with-new-thread
  (dotimes [_ 10]
    (Thread/sleep 1000)
    (dosync (alter r inc))
    (println "updated ref1 to" @r)))

(with-new-thread
  (println "ref outside of tx is" @r)
  (dosync 
   (let [r1init @r]
    (dotimes [_ 7]
      (if (not (= r1init @r))
	(println "ref1 has changed")
	(println "ref1 has not changed"))
      (Thread/sleep 1000))))
  (println "ref outside of tx is" @r))


* Consistency of Read Against Multiple Refs

(def r1 (ref 0))
(def r2 (ref 0))

(with-new-thread
  (dotimes [_ 10]
    (Thread/sleep 1000)
    (dosync 
     (alter r1 inc)
     (alter r2 inc)
     (Thread/sleep 500))
    (println "updated ref1/2 to" @r1)))

(with-new-thread
  (dotimes [_ 10]
   (dosync 
    (let [r1-value @r1] 
      (println "read ref1")
      (Thread/sleep 1500)
      (let [r2-value @r2] 
	(println "read ref2")
	(println "r1 is" r1-value "r2 is" r2-value)
	(Thread/sleep 1000))))))


* The io! Macro

- Use it to prevent running in a transaction

clojure.core/io!
([& body])
Macro
  If an io! block occurs in a transaction, throws an
  IllegalStateException, else runs body in an implicit do.
  If the first expression in body is a literal string, 
  will use that as the exception message.

* Uniform state transition

- Refs

(dosync (commute foo assoc :a "a"))

- Agents

(send foo assoc :a "a")

- Atoms

(swap! foo assoc :a "a")

* Uniform state transition model

- (<change-state-ops> reference function [args*])
- Function passed current state of reference plus args
- Return value of function is next state of reference
- Clojure swaps ref only
- deref always gives current state
- No user locking, no deadlocks
- Readers not blocked
- Writers not blocked by other readers

* Futures

TODO

* Promises

TODO


* End!

* Misc
** Non-atomic copies of longs (bad)
** My experience with web services: immutability good
** What happens if there are two writes? Last writer win? 
** What is the difference between alter and commute? 

* The Stash

** Why Functional?

Makes a ton of sense because side effects kill retries, 
without which it becomes difficult to implement concurrency
without resorting to locking. 

** Why Not Purely Functional? 

Because it's nice to have enough rope to hang yourself.  

** Racewalk Example

Looking at the world while it's changing doesn't work. 

Racewalk example: 

1. Look at left foot
2. Look at right foot
3. If both off the ground: foul

Bzzzt. Wrong. 

Obviously, the world itself can't stop. But we can 
take a picture of it and look at the picture. 

** Destructuring bind

;; For maps
(def craig {:name "craig" :age 37})
(let [{name :name} craig] name) => "craig"

;; For vectors
(def v [1 2 3 4 5])
(let [[x y & zs] v] (str x ", " y ", " zs))
  => "1, 2, (3, 4, 5)"

** Transients

(doc transient) => 
-------------------------
clojure.core/transient
([coll])
  Returns a new, transient version of the collection, in constant time.

TODO: How does this work again?
